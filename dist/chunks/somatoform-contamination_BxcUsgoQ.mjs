						const body = "## Executive Summary\n\nOn **5 January 2023**, during a routine telephone consultation about switching opioid medications, Dr Bulale Ali entered a diagnosis of **Somatoform Pain Disorder (F45.4)** into John Thomson's medical records. This occurred:\n\n- **After** MRI imaging had already confirmed T5-T8 vertebral fractures\n- **Without** any psychiatric assessment\n- **Without** informing the patient\n\nThe diagnosis was later **independently removed** by Dr Alexander Gorrie in July 2025 with the note: *\"there were clear causes for his pain.\"*\n\n## The Clinical Context\n\n### What Was Known at the Time\n\nBy January 2023, the following was documented in the patient's medical records:\n\n1. **October 2022 MRI** - Confirmed T5-T8 vertebral fractures with \"altered marrow signal\" and \"irregularity of the vertebral endplates\"\n2. **December 2021 Seizure** - Documented tonic-clonic seizure resulting in the fractures\n3. **Ongoing Pain Management** - Patient under Pain Clinic care at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital\n4. **Medication Requirements** - High-dose opioid requirements for documented pathology\n\n### The Consultation of 5 January 2023\n\nThe purpose of the telephone consultation was to discuss **medication switching** from one opioid formulation to another. During this call:\n\n- No psychiatric assessment was conducted\n- No mental state examination was performed\n- No questions about psychological symptoms were asked\n- The patient was not informed a psychiatric diagnosis was being applied\n\nDespite this, Dr Ali entered the following into the clinical record:\n\n> **Diagnosis: Somatoform Pain Disorder**  \n> *ICD-10 Code: E278 (incorrect - should be F45.4)*\n\nThe use of the wrong ICD-10 code (E278 is an endocrine disorder code) suggests unfamiliarity with the diagnosis being applied.\n\n## Breach of Standard of Care\n\n### GMC and NICE Requirements\n\nThe application of psychiatric diagnoses without appropriate assessment breaches multiple standards:\n\n**GMC Good Medical Practice (2024):**\n- Doctors must make \"accurate diagnoses\" based on \"adequate assessment\"\n- Patients must be given information about their diagnosis\n- Diagnoses should be within the doctor's competence\n\n**NICE CG91 (Depression in Adults with Chronic Physical Health Problems):**\n- Warns against misattributing physical symptoms to psychological causes\n- Emphasises the need for proper psychiatric assessment before applying psychiatric diagnoses\n\n### What Assessment Would Have Been Required\n\nTo legitimately diagnose Somatoform Pain Disorder (F45.4), the following would be necessary:\n\n1. **Full psychiatric history**\n2. **Mental state examination**\n3. **Exclusion of organic causes** (impossible when fractures were already confirmed)\n4. **Duration criteria** (symptoms >6 months causing significant distress)\n5. **Differential diagnosis consideration**\n\nNone of these steps occurred.\n\n## The \"Contamination\" Effect\n\n### How the Label Spread\n\nOnce entered into the GP record, the somatoform diagnosis:\n\n1. **Appeared in summary screens** visible to all subsequent clinicians\n2. **Was transmitted via GP Connect** to NHS services\n3. **Influenced clinical decision-making** in secondary care\n4. **Created a psychiatric framing** for a patient with documented organic pathology\n\n### Evidence of Impact\n\nThe Pain Clinic at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital later documented their explicit disagreement:\n\n> *\"GP prev told somatic, pain clinic at C&W; felt not somatic.\"*  \n> — Pain Clinic clinical notes\n\nThis demonstrates that the inappropriate GP diagnosis was actively interfering with specialist pain management.\n\n## Independent Vindication\n\n### Dr Gorrie's Removal (July 2025)\n\nDr Alexander Gorrie, reviewing the patient's records as the new GP, **independently marked the Somatoform diagnosis as INACTIVE** with the following note:\n\n> *\"there were clear causes for his pain.\"*\n\nThis is highly unusual. GPs typically require formal psychiatric reassessment before removing psychiatric diagnoses. That Dr Gorrie removed it without such reassessment indicates the error was **self-evident** from reviewing the medical records.\n\n### Pain Clinic Refutation (2023)\n\nThe Chelsea & Westminster Pain Clinic explicitly documented that the somatoform characterisation was:\n\n> *\"NOT their opinion\"*\n\n## Legal Significance\n\n### Breach of Duty\n\nThe application of a psychiatric diagnosis:\n- Without psychiatric assessment\n- After objective pathology was confirmed\n- Without patient knowledge\n\n...constitutes a clear breach of the duty of care owed by a GP to their patient.\n\n### Causation\n\nThe \"contamination\" of the medical record with this diagnosis:\n- Influenced subsequent clinical encounters\n- Created a barrier to appropriate treatment\n- Caused psychological harm through the implication of fabrication\n\n### The Bolam Test\n\nNo responsible body of GPs would support:\n- Applying F45.4 without psychiatric assessment\n- Applying somatoform diagnosis when organic pathology is confirmed\n- Failing to inform the patient of such a diagnosis\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe entry of Somatoform Pain Disorder on 5 January 2023 represents a fundamental breach of medical standards. It was applied:\n\n- **Inappropriately** - without assessment\n- **Incorrectly** - despite confirmed fractures\n- **Covertly** - without patient knowledge\n- **Harmfully** - contaminating the medical record\n\nThe subsequent independent removal by Dr Gorrie, and explicit refutation by the Pain Clinic, confirm that this diagnosis should never have been applied.\n\n---\n\n*This essay is based on contemporaneous medical records and independent clinical documentation.
