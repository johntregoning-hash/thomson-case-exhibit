Despite this objective evidence of vascular compression, the condition has not received definitive treatment.\n\nThe symptom severity has been documented by specialists: the patient has stated he would *\"rather his arm be amputated\"* than continue living with the unrelieved symptoms.\n\n## Understanding Thoracic Outlet Syndrome\n\n### What Is TOS?\n\nThoracic Outlet Syndrome refers to compression of nerves, arteries, or veins in the **thoracic outlet** — the space between the collarbone and first rib.\n\n**Types:**\n- **Neurogenic TOS** — Nerve compression (most common)\n- **Venous TOS** — Vein compression\n- **Arterial TOS** — Artery compression (rarest, most dangerous)\n\nJohn Thomson has documented **vascular TOS** with evidence of both arterial and venous compression.\n\n### Symptoms\n\nTOS can cause:\n- Pain in neck, shoulder, and arm\n- Numbness and tingling\n- Weakness in hand/arm\n- Colour changes in hand\n- Swelling\n- Blood clots (in vascular forms)\n\n## The Six-Year Timeline\n\n### 2019: First Positive Study\n\n**13 June 2019 — Duplex Ultrasound, Royal Free Hospital**\n\n> *\"Complete cessation of flow within the distal subclavian artery during Adson's and EAST manoeuvres bilaterally. Marked haemodynamic changes noted... This is a positive result.\"*\n\nThis is unambiguous. In 2019, objective testing demonstrated vascular compression causing complete flow cessation.\n\n### 2024: MR Confirmation\n\n**10 January 2024 — MR Thoracic Inlet, UCLH**\n\nDr An Thanh Ngo reported:\n> *\"Compression of the left subclavian artery and vein in the subclavicular space with arms abducted\"*\n\nAnd:\n> *\"Apparent focal stenosis\"*\n\nFive years after the first positive study, imaging confirms ongoing vascular compression.\n\n### 2024: CT Cannot Exclude TOS\n\n**16 April 2024 — CT Aorta, UCLH**\n\nThe radiologist specifically noted:\n> *\"A thoracic outlet syndrome affecting left subclavian artery cannot be excluded on static imaging\"*\n\nThe radiologist acknowledged the limitations of the study and recommended dynamic assessment.\n\n### 2025: Doppler Confirms Bilateral Occlusion\n\n**9 June 2025 — Duplex Doppler, Royal Free Hospital**\n\n> *\"At 90° abduction, both subclavian veins compressed with no flow\"*\n\nSix years after the first positive study, bilateral vascular occlusion is documented on dynamic testing.\n\n### 2024: MRA Confirmation\n\n**July 2024 — MRA, Royal Free Hospital**\n\nMr Aaron Goh documented:\n> *\"MRA... confirms compression and focal stenosis of subclavian arteries bilaterally\"*\n\nMultiple imaging modalities now confirm the same pathology.\n\n## The Diagnostic Journey\n\n| Year | Study | Finding | Action Taken |\n|------|-------|---------|--------------|\n| 2019 | Duplex US | Positive TOS | No definitive treatment |\n| 2020-2023 | — | Symptoms continue | Managed conservatively |\n| 2024 | MR, CT, MRA | TOS confirmed | Specialist review |\n| 2025 | Duplex | Bilateral occlusion | Ongoing assessment |\n\nDespite six years of documented pathology, definitive surgical intervention has not occurred.\n\n## Specialist Documentation of Suffering\n\n### Extreme Symptom Severity\n\nThe vascular surgery documentation records:\n> *\"Patient would rather his arm be amputated\"*\n\nThis extraordinary statement reflects:\n- The severity of ongoing symptoms\n- The frustration with lack of definitive treatment\n- The desperation of living with unrelieved vascular compromise\n\n### Functional Impact\n\nThe patient experiences:\n- Severe arm pain\n- Limited arm use\n- Sleep disruption from positional symptoms\n- Reduced quality of life\n\n## Why The Delay?\n\n### Static vs Dynamic Imaging\n\nTOS is a **positional** condition — compression occurs in certain arm positions. Standard imaging may not capture it:\n\n- **Static imaging** (arms down) may appear normal\n- **Dynamic imaging** (arms abducted) reveals compression\n\nThe 2024 CT radiologist specifically noted this limitation.\n\n### \"Functional\" Narrative Interference\n\nThe inappropriate psychiatric framing may have contributed to delays:\n- Symptoms attributed to \"somatoform\" disorder\n- Reluctance to investigate \"psychological\" symptoms\n- Specialist referrals delayed\n\n### Surgical Complexity\n\nTOS surgery (first rib resection) is complex and carries risks. However:\n- The decision to not operate should follow from proper assessment\n- Conservative management should be planned, not default\n- Ongoing suffering requires ongoing review\n\n## Legal Significance\n\n### Breach Analysis\n\nThe failure to definitively treat documented TOS over six years raises questions about:\n\n1. **Appropriate escalation** — Was specialist opinion sought promptly?\n2. **Treatment planning** — Was conservative vs surgical management properly discussed?\n3. **Symptom acknowledgment** — Were complaints taken seriously or attributed to psychology?\n\n### Causation\n\nWhile TOS was not caused by GP negligence, the **diagnostic and treatment delay** may have:\n- Prolonged unnecessary suffering\n- Allowed condition progression\n- Denied appropriate treatment options\n\n### The \"Functional\" Contamination\n\nThe inappropriate somatoform diagnosis likely:\n- Delayed specialist referral\n- Influenced how symptoms were perceived\n- Created barriers to objective assessment\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJohn Thomson has had **documented vascular TOS** since at least June 2019:\n\n- **2019**: First positive Duplex — \"complete cessation of flow\"\n- **2024**: MR, CT, MRA all consistent with TOS\n- **2025**: Bilateral venous occlusion confirmed\n\nYet six years later, definitive treatment has not occurred, and the patient has expressed willingness to undergo **amputation** rather than continue with unrelieved symptoms.\n\nThis six-year timeline of documented pathology — during which the patient was labelled with somatoform disorder — represents a fundamental failure of the medical system to address objective organic disease.\n\n---\n\n*This essay is based on imaging reports, specialist letters, and clinical documentation spanning 2019-2025.*";
