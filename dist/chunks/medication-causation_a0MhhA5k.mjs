This essay documents the causation chain linking this seizure to **abrupt pregabalin withdrawal** two months earlier.\n\nThe British National Formulary (BNF) explicitly warns that pregabalin withdrawal can cause seizures and mandates gradual reduction. This guidance was not followed.\n\n## The Medication: Pregabalin\n\n### Clinical Use\n\nPregabalin (Lyrica) is a gabapentinoid medication used for:\n- Neuropathic pain\n- Generalised anxiety disorder\n- Epilepsy (adjunctive therapy)\n\nJohn Thomson was prescribed pregabalin **600mg daily** for neuropathic pain management.\n\n### Known Withdrawal Risks\n\nThe BNF states:\n\n> *\"Abrupt withdrawal of pregabalin should be avoided... withdraw gradually over at least 1 week\"*\n\nThe BNF specifically lists **seizures** as a withdrawal effect, even in patients without epilepsy history.\n\n## The Withdrawal Event: October 2021\n\n### The Prescription Change\n\nIn October 2021, John Thomson's pregabalin was reduced from **600mg to 100mg** — an 83% reduction — over approximately **2-3 days**.\n\nThis was dramatically faster than the BNF-mandated minimum of 1 week for gradual withdrawal.\n\n### Contributing Factors\n\nAt the time of withdrawal, the patient was also experiencing:\n\n**1. Severe Sleep Deprivation**\n- 14+ months of documented sleep disturbance\n- Pain preventing restorative sleep\n- Sleep deprivation is a known seizure threshold-lowering factor\n\n**2. Untreated Pain**\n- Medication changes were affecting pain control\n- Stress from uncontrolled pain can lower seizure threshold\n\n## The Seizure: 23 December 2021\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **October 2021**: Pregabalin abruptly reduced\n- **November-December 2021**: Two months of subtherapeutic pregabalin\n- **23 December 2021**: Tonic-clonic seizure at home\n\n### The Event\n\nThe seizure resulted in:\n- Fall with high-impact trauma\n- T5-T8 vertebral fractures\n- Rib injuries\n- Subsequent chronic pain requiring escalated management\n\n## Independent Specialist Confirmation\n\n### Dr Simeoni's Documentation\n\nDr Simeoni, reviewing the patient's history, documented:\n\n> *\"When had a seizure pregabalin had been stopped abruptly\"*\n\nThis independent clinical correlation directly links the abrupt withdrawal to the seizure event.\n\n### Formal Epilepsy Diagnosis\n\nIn **December 2024**, the patient received a **formal epilepsy diagnosis** from Imperial College Healthcare neurology services.\n\nThis is significant because:\n- The seizure was **not functional/dissociative** (NEAD)\n- It was a **genuine neurological event**\n- The patient has ongoing seizure risk requiring management\n\n## The Pattern Repeats\n\n### OxyContin Withdrawal Warning Ignored\n\nDespite the pregabalin/seizure connection being documented, the same GP practice later:\n\n1. **Abruptly stopped OxyContin** (strong opioid)\n2. **Despite Pain Clinic warning** that abrupt cessation risked seizures\n3. **Same pattern** of ignoring withdrawal guidance\n\nThe Pain Clinic had specifically documented:\n\n> *\"Do not stop OxyContin abruptly — seizure risk\"*\n\nThis warning was not heeded.\n\n## Causation Analysis\n\n### The \"But For\" Test\n\n**But for** the abrupt pregabalin reduction:\n- The patient's seizure threshold would not have been lowered\n- The 23 December 2021 seizure would not have occurred\n- The vertebral fractures would not have been sustained\n- The subsequent cascade of harm would not have followed\n\n### Contributory Negligence Assessment\n\nThe causation chain includes:\n\n1. **Breach**: Abrupt pregabalin withdrawal contrary to BNF guidance\n2. **Vulnerability**: Sleep deprivation lowering seizure threshold\n3. **Event**: Tonic-clonic seizure on 23 December 2021\n4. **Harm**: T5-T8 fractures, chronic pain, ongoing epilepsy\n\nEach link in this chain is documented in medical records.\n\n## Standard of Care Analysis\n\n### BNF Guidance\n\nThe British National Formulary is the UK standard reference for medication prescribing. Its guidance on pregabalin withdrawal is:\n\n- Withdraw **gradually**\n- Over **at least 1 week**\n- **Seizures** are a documented withdrawal effect\n\n### What Should Have Happened\n\nA competent GP reducing pregabalin from 600mg should have:\n\n1. **Planned a taper** over minimum 1 week (typically 2-4 weeks from 600mg)\n2. **Warned the patient** about withdrawal symptoms\n3. **Monitored** for adverse effects\n4. **Not reduced** more than 50-75mg per day\n\nNone of these steps occurred.\n\n## The Ongoing Impact\n\n### Epilepsy Diagnosis\n\nThe patient now has:\n- Formal epilepsy diagnosis\n- Ongoing antiepileptic medication requirements\n- Restrictions on driving\n- Ongoing seizure risk\n\n### Physical Harm\n\nThe seizure caused:\n- T5-T8 vertebral fractures\n- Chronic pain requiring opioid management\n- Functional limitations\n- 10-month diagnostic delay (see separate essay)\n\n### Psychological Harm\n\nThe patient experienced:\n- Trauma from the seizure event\n- Frustration at preventable harm\n- Damage to trust in medical care\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe causation chain from abrupt pregabalin withdrawal to the December 2021 seizure is clearly established:\n\n1. **BNF guidance** requires gradual pregabalin withdrawal\n2. **This guidance was breached** — 83% reduction over 2-3 days\n3. **Two months later** — tonic-clonic seizure occurred\n4. **Independent specialist** documented the causal link\n5. **Formal epilepsy diagnosis** confirms genuine neurological event\n\nThe subsequent vertebral fractures and their consequences flow directly from this negligent medication management.\n\n---\n\n*This essay is based on BNF guidance, contemporaneous medical records, and independent specialist documentation.*";
