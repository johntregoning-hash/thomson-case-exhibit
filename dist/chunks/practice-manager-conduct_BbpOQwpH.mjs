						const body = "## Executive Summary\n\nThis essay documents concerns about the conduct of **Clive Polles**, Practice Manager at the former GP practice, and his involvement in **clinical decision-making** without clinical qualifications.\n\nEvidence suggests that non-clinical management was influencing patient care decisions in ways that may have contributed to the December 2021 seizure event.\n\n## The Role of Practice Manager\n\n### Standard Responsibilities\n\nA GP Practice Manager typically handles:\n- Administrative operations\n- Staff management\n- Financial oversight\n- Regulatory compliance\n- Premises management\n\nPractice Managers are **not clinicians** and should not make clinical decisions about patient care.\n\n### What the Evidence Shows\n\nDocumentation and witness accounts suggest that Clive Polles:\n\n1. **Directly communicated** with patients about clinical matters\n2. **Influenced medication decisions** beyond administrative scope\n3. **Made \"off the books\" calls** to patient's family members\n4. Was involved in decisions with **clinical consequences**\n\n## The Medication Refusal\n\n### Four Days Before the Seizure\n\nIn December 2021, medication was refused from the practice **4 days before** John Thomson's tonic-clonic seizure on 23 December.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding this refusal raise questions about:\n- Who made the decision\n- What clinical basis existed\n- Whether appropriate protocols were followed\n\n### Clinical Consequence\n\nWhether or not this specific refusal contributed to the seizure, the pattern of non-clinical involvement in medication decisions is concerning from a governance perspective.\n\n## iMessage Evidence\n\n### Direct Communications\n\niMessage records show direct communications from Clive Polles to patient family members about clinical matters.\n\nThese communications:\n- Were outside normal GP-patient channels\n- Did not follow standard documentation protocols\n- Raised concerns about professional boundaries\n\n### \"Off the Books\" Calls\n\nThe patient's mother received telephone calls making claims that were subsequently **disprovable** based on documented evidence.\n\nThese calls:\n- Were not documented in medical records\n- Made claims contradicted by written evidence\n- Appeared designed to influence the family's understanding\n\n## Dr Gorrie's Comments\n\n### \"Sketchy Stuff\"\n\nDr Alexander Gorrie, the current GP, made reference to:\n> *\"sketchy stuff\"*\n\n...that had blocked a proposed merger with the former practice.\n\nWhile the specifics are not detailed, this comment from an NHS GP suggests awareness of concerning conduct at the former practice.\n\n## Governance Concerns\n\n### Professional Boundaries\n\nGMC and NHS governance standards require clear boundaries between:\n- Clinical staff (who make clinical decisions)\n- Administrative staff (who support operations)\n\nWhen these boundaries blur, patient safety can be compromised.\n\n### Accountability\n\nClinical decisions should be:\n- Made by qualified clinicians\n- Documented in medical records\n- Subject to clinical governance oversight\n\nNon-clinical involvement obscures accountability when things go wrong.\n\n## Legal Significance\n\n### Vicarious Liability\n\nThe GP practice is responsible for the actions of its employees, including:\n- GPs\n- Nurses\n- Administrative staff\n\nIf non-clinical staff influenced clinical decisions that caused harm, the practice bears responsibility.\n\n### Evidence Preservation\n\nThe pattern of \"off the books\" communications raises concerns about:\n- Record-keeping practices\n- Evidence preservation\n- Transparency in patient care\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile this essay does not establish a direct causal link between practice manager conduct and the patient's injuries, it documents a pattern of:\n\n1. **Inappropriate clinical involvement** by non-clinical staff\n2. **Communication outside normal channels** with patient/family\n3. **Concerns recognised** by subsequent NHS clinicians\n\nThese governance failures form part of the broader picture of inadequate care at the former practice.\n\n---\n\n*This essay is based on documented communications, medical records, and contemporaneous accounts.*";
