summary: "Documents the 10-month delay in diagnosing T5-T8 vertebral fractures from the December 2021 seizure until MRI confirmation in October 2022. Initial A&E assessment dismissed the injury as 'soft tissue' despite NICE NG59 red flag presentation. The delay was compounded by imaging the wrong spinal region (lumbar instead of thoracic)."
keyArguments:
  - "NICE NG59 red flags present but not actioned"
  - "Initial A&E dismissed injury as 'soft tissue'"
  - "Wrong spinal region imaged (lumbar MRI when thoracic was symptomatic)"
  - "Patient discharged from Neurospine because 'no surgical target' - on lumbar MRI"
  - "10 months of undiagnosed vertebral fractures caused prolonged suffering"
  - "Thoracic MRI eventually confirmed T5-T8 fractures"

## Executive Summary

Following a tonic-clonic seizure on **23 December 2021**, John Thomson sustained T5-T8 vertebral fractures that would remain undiagnosed for **ten months**. The delay was not inevitable — it resulted from:

1. **A&E dismissing** the injury as "soft tissue" despite red flag symptoms
2. **Imaging the wrong region** — lumbar MRI when thoracic spine was symptomatic
3. **Discharging the patient** from Neurospine based on the wrong imaging

It was not until **October 2022** that thoracic MRI finally confirmed what the patient had been reporting: significant spinal injury.

## The Index Event: 23 December 2021

### The Seizure

On the morning of 23 December 2021, John Thomson experienced a tonic-clonic seizure at home. During the event:

- He fell heavily
- His body struck furniture
- He experienced immediate severe thoracic back pain

### A&E Presentation

The patient presented to Accident & Emergency with:

- **Acute thoracic spine pain** following seizure
- **Difficulty moving** due to pain
- **Point tenderness** over mid-thoracic region
- **Mechanism of injury** — high-impact fall during seizure

### NICE NG59 Red Flags

NICE Guideline NG59 (Low back pain and sciatica in over 16s) identifies red flags requiring urgent investigation. While technically for lumbar spine, the principles apply:

**Red flags present in this case:**
- Trauma mechanism (seizure with fall)
- Severe localised pain
- New neurological symptoms
- Age-related fracture risk

Despite these indicators, the injury was dismissed as **"soft tissue"** and the patient was discharged without imaging.

## The Wrong Imaging Problem

### Lumbar MRI Instead of Thoracic

When spinal imaging was eventually arranged, it was ordered for the **lumbar spine** — not the **thoracic spine** where the patient was experiencing symptoms.

The patient's symptoms were clearly localised to the mid-back (T5-T8 region). However:

- Referral was for lumbar MRI
- Lumbar MRI (predictably) showed no acute pathology
- Patient was discharged from Neurospine clinic

### The Neurospine Discharge

The Neurospine clinic documented:

> *"No surgical target identified on lumbar MRI"*

This was correct — there was no surgical target in the **lumbar** spine. However, the actual injury was in the **thoracic** spine, which remained unimaged.

The patient continued to report thoracic symptoms, but was now discharged from the pathway that could have identified the injury.

## The 10-Month Timeline

| Date | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| Dec 2021 | Seizure and A&E attendance | Dismissed as "soft tissue" |
| Jan 2022 | GP consultations for ongoing pain | Managed with analgesia |
| Feb-Mar 2022 | Repeated presentations | No imaging ordered |
| Apr 2022 | Lumbar MRI arranged | Wrong region imaged |
| May 2022 | Neurospine review | Discharged - "no target" |
| Jun-Sep 2022 | Continued symptoms | Pain management only |
| Oct 2022 | **Thoracic MRI finally performed** | **T5-T8 fractures confirmed** |

## The October 2022 MRI Findings

The thoracic MRI report documented:

> *"Altered marrow signal at T5-T8 with irregularity of the vertebral endplates consistent with healing fractures"*

After ten months of suffering, the fractures the patient had been reporting were finally confirmed.

## Breach Analysis

### Standard of Care Failures

**1. A&E Assessment**
- Red flag presentation dismissed
- No imaging ordered despite mechanism of injury
- Patient discharged without adequate investigation

**2. GP Management**
- Repeated presentations without imaging escalation
- Over-reliance on initial A&E assessment
- Failure to recognise pattern of persistent symptoms

**3. Imaging Request**
- Wrong spinal region requested
- Symptom location not considered in imaging protocol
- Clinical correlation failure

**4. Neurospine Discharge**
- Discharged patient without thoracic imaging
- Did not question why lumbar imaging was ordered for thoracic symptoms
- No safety-netting for continued symptoms

### The Bolam Test

No responsible body of medical practitioners would support:

- Dismissing post-seizure spinal trauma as "soft tissue" without imaging
- Imaging the lumbar spine when thoracic symptoms are reported
- Discharging a patient with ongoing symptoms based on imaging of the wrong region

## Consequences of the Delay

### Physical Impact

Ten months of undiagnosed vertebral fractures caused:

- **Prolonged pain** requiring escalating analgesia
- **Potential delayed healing** without appropriate management
- **Continued activity** that may have worsened the injury
- **Psychological distress** from unexplained symptoms

### Systemic Impact

The failure to diagnose the fractures contributed to:

- **The somatoform narrative** — unexplained pain was attributed to psychological causes
- **Credibility damage** — the patient was not believed when reporting injury
- **Treatment delays** — appropriate pain management was withheld

## Conclusion

The 10-month delay in diagnosing T5-T8 vertebral fractures represents a cascade of clinical failures:

1. Initial dismissal of red flag presentation
2. Imaging the wrong spinal region
3. Discharging the patient based on irrelevant imaging
4. Failing to escalate despite persistent symptoms

Each failure compounded the last. At any point, appropriate clinical attention to the patient's reported symptoms and mechanism of injury would have led to correct diagnosis.

The eventual October 2022 MRI vindicated everything the patient had been reporting. The fractures were real, significant, and should have been identified in December 2021.
