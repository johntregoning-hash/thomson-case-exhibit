## Executive Summary

This essay documents concerns about the conduct of **Clive Polles**, Practice Manager at the former GP practice, and his involvement in **clinical decision-making** without clinical qualifications.

Evidence suggests that non-clinical management was influencing patient care decisions in ways that may have contributed to the December 2021 seizure event.

## The Role of Practice Manager

### Standard Responsibilities

A GP Practice Manager typically handles:
- Administrative operations
- Staff management
- Financial oversight
- Regulatory compliance
- Premises management

Practice Managers are **not clinicians** and should not make clinical decisions about patient care.

### What the Evidence Shows

Documentation and witness accounts suggest that Clive Polles:

1. **Directly communicated** with patients about clinical matters
2. **Influenced medication decisions** beyond administrative scope
3. **Made "off the books" calls** to patient's family members
4. Was involved in decisions with **clinical consequences**

## The Medication Refusal

### Four Days Before the Seizure

In December 2021, medication was refused from the practice **4 days before** John Thomson's tonic-clonic seizure on 23 December.

The circumstances surrounding this refusal raise questions about:
- Who made the decision
- What clinical basis existed
- Whether appropriate protocols were followed

### Clinical Consequence

Whether or not this specific refusal contributed to the seizure, the pattern of non-clinical involvement in medication decisions is concerning from a governance perspective.

## iMessage Evidence

### Direct Communications

iMessage records show direct communications from Clive Polles to patient family members about clinical matters.

These communications:
- Were outside normal GP-patient channels
- Did not follow standard documentation protocols
- Raised concerns about professional boundaries

### "Off the Books" Calls

The patient's mother received telephone calls making claims that were subsequently **disprovable** based on documented evidence.

These calls:
- Were not documented in medical records
- Made claims contradicted by written evidence
- Appeared designed to influence the family's understanding

## Dr Gorrie's Comments

### "Sketchy Stuff"

Dr Alexander Gorrie, the current GP, made reference to:
> *"sketchy stuff"*

...that had blocked a proposed merger with the former practice.

While the specifics are not detailed, this comment from an NHS GP suggests awareness of concerning conduct at the former practice.

## Governance Concerns

### Professional Boundaries

GMC and NHS governance standards require clear boundaries between:
- Clinical staff (who make clinical decisions)
- Administrative staff (who support operations)

When these boundaries blur, patient safety can be compromised.

### Accountability

Clinical decisions should be:
- Made by qualified clinicians
- Documented in medical records
- Subject to clinical governance oversight

Non-clinical involvement obscures accountability when things go wrong.

## Legal Significance

### Vicarious Liability

The GP practice is responsible for the actions of its employees, including:
- GPs
- Nurses
- Administrative staff

If non-clinical staff influenced clinical decisions that caused harm, the practice bears responsibility.

### Evidence Preservation

The pattern of "off the books" communications raises concerns about:
- Record-keeping practices
- Evidence preservation
- Transparency in patient care

## Conclusion

While this essay does not establish a direct causal link between practice manager conduct and the patient's injuries, it documents a pattern of:

1. **Inappropriate clinical involvement** by non-clinical staff
2. **Communication outside normal channels** with patient/family
3. **Concerns recognised** by subsequent NHS clinicians

These governance failures form part of the broader picture of inadequate care at the former practice.
