## Executive Summary

This essay documents a disturbing pattern: the systematic exploitation of John Thomson's grief over his older brother Dorian's suicide to justify psychiatric dismissal of documented physical pathology. Rather than investigating reported symptoms, healthcare providers repeatedly invoked the family bereavement to frame physical complaints as psychological — even after MRI confirmed T5-T8 vertebral fractures.

The pattern reveals:
- **Seven documented GP entries** referencing Dorian's death in clinical notes
- **Pain Clinic referral rejection** using suicide concerns as pretext — without speaking to the patient
- **Somatoform diagnosis applied** without psychiatric assessment, years after the bereavement
- **Independent verification** that the weaponisation was recognised by third-party clinicians

## Who Was Dorian Thomson

Dorian Thomson was John Thomson's older brother — a male model who suffered from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). He died by suicide in 2011 after years of inadequately treated chronic pain.

### Key Facts

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Relationship** | John Thomson's older brother |
| **Diagnosis** | EDS diagnosed in 2008 by rheumatologist at London Bridge Hospital |
| **Prior Dismissal** | GP had written that "the problems were all in his mind" |
| **Course** | Years of being "brushed off by his GP" before diagnosis |
| **Outcome** | Suicide due to untreated chronic pain |
| **Public Record** | Daily Mail article (2012) intended to raise awareness of EDS dismissal |

### The Parallel Pattern

The cruel irony: the same dismissal pattern that contributed to Dorian's death was then repeated with his brother John.

| Element | Dorian Thomson (2008-2011) | John Thomson (2019-Present) |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Condition | EDS | EDS (hypermobility spectrum) |
| GP Response | "Problems all in his mind" | Somatoform Pain Disorder diagnosed |
| Physical Evidence | Pain dismissed | Vertebral fractures dismissed |
| Psychiatric Labelling | Psychological attribution | F45.4/E278 diagnosis applied |
| Pain Clinic | Support came "too late" | Pain Clinic rejected patient |

## The Weaponisation Pattern

### Documented GP Entries Referencing Brother/Suicide

| Date | Entry ID | Actor | Nature of Reference | Finding Ref |
|------|----------|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| 22 Jul 2020 | 2020-126 | Dr Amit Gupta | "Discussed hx of his brother who committed suicide... explore whether there is a **somatoform type condition**" | F002, F045 |
| 23 Oct 2020 | 2020-251 | Dr Amit Gupta | "Feels he may be on **same path as his brother**... addressing his **mental health will be the way for him to feel better**" | F045 |
| 04 Nov 2020 | 2020-266 | Dr Amit Gupta | "I have discussed the **parallels between his brother** who died with unexplained pain and his case seem to be **converging**" | F045 |
| 25 Oct 2021 | 2021-430 | Sumeer Bhamm (MSK Physio) | "They mention concerns of suicide... **Pain Clinic has used this as a way to reject the referral**" | F043, F091 |
| 15 Nov 2021 | 2021-448 | Sumeer Bhamm (MSK Physio) | "Patient **not suicidal**... **referral was rejected without speaking to patient**" | F043, F091 |
| 02 Aug 2023 | 2023-388 | Dr Sian Morgan | "pt lost brother aged 41 to suicide -10 yrs ago" [same entry as addiction claim] | F045 |
| 18 Aug 2023 | 2023-419 | Dr Richard Drewry | Patient reports: "They said pain was **psychosomatic, attention seeking**. Doing **same behaviour as brother**" | F045 |

### Critical Observations

**Dr Amit Gupta Pattern (2020):**
Three entries in four months explicitly linking John to Dorian's fate — this is narrative construction, not clinical reasoning. The phrase "same path as his brother" is particularly damaging, suggesting John was heading toward suicide rather than suffering from physical pathology.

**Pain Clinic Rejection Mechanism (2021):**
John's mother called with concerns about his wellbeing. This call was then used to **reject** a Pain Clinic referral — without anyone speaking to the patient to assess his actual mental state. This occurred **38 days before the seizure** that caused T5-T8 vertebral fractures.

**MSK Physio as Independent Witness:**
Sumeer Bhamm, a third-party NHS clinician with no connection to the GP surgery, documented both the weaponisation mechanism AND John's explicit denial of suicidal ideation. This independent verification is Tier 5 evidence corroborating the pattern.

**Morgan Entry Co-occurrence (2023):**
The "opiate addiction" claim and Dorian reference appear in the **same entry** — demonstrating how family history was invoked alongside false diagnoses.

## The Rejection Mechanism

### October 2021: Pain Clinic Referral Blocked

The most egregious instance of weaponisation occurred when John's Pain Clinic referral was rejected:

> "Mother called them prior and based on what she said the **referral was rejected without speaking to patient**"

**Timeline:**
- Mother calls with concerns about John's welfare
- Pain Clinic uses this to reject referral
- Patient never contacted to assess actual state
- **38 days later:** Seizure causes T5-T8 vertebral fractures

Had proper pain management been provided, the seizure — caused by abrupt pregabalin reduction — might have been prevented.

## Clinical Distinctions

**Dorian's case and John's case are clinically independent:**

- John was NOT present at Dorian's death
- John does NOT have the same specific EDS subtype
- John HAS objective imaging showing vertebral fractures (T5-T8)
- John HAS documented seizures with ambulance records
- John's pain has documented mechanical causes (fractures, TOS, SCDS)

Using one brother's tragic death to justify non-treatment of another's documented physical pathology constitutes:
- Diagnostic overshadowing
- Failure to investigate
- Potential bad faith conduct

## The Vindication

### What Independent Clinicians Found

**Dr Gupta (Psychiatrist, 2023):**
Formal psychiatric assessment found **NO** PTSD, depression, psychosis, personality disorder, **or somatisation disorder**.

**Dr Gorrie (GP, July 2025):**
Removed the somatoform diagnosis, noting:
> "there were clear causes for his pain"

**Pain Clinic (2023):**
Explicitly stated somatoform was "NOT their opinion."

**Dr Karunaratne (Neurologist, December 2023):**
> "medical explanations have been found for symptoms that he has been experiencing for a very long time"

## Legal Significance

### Why This Matters

**1. Demonstrates Pattern of Psychiatric Dismissal**
The same pattern that killed Dorian is being applied to John. The healthcare system learned nothing from the prior death.

**2. Shows Intent Beyond Clinical Error**
Using a family tragedy to justify non-treatment is not a good-faith clinical mistake. It suggests deliberate strategy to avoid providing care.

**3. Establishes Foreseeable Harm**
NHS providers were explicitly warned (via public articles about Dorian's case) about EDS dismissal. Repeating the pattern with his sibling demonstrates wilful blindness.

**4. Aggravates Quantum**
The psychological cruelty of having his brother's death repeatedly invoked constitutes additional psychiatric injury beyond the physical harm from delayed diagnosis.

### Potential Claims

- **Negligence:** Failure to investigate despite documented pathology
- **Data Protection:** Recording unfounded psychiatric diagnosis
- **Human Rights:** Inhuman/degrading treatment through systematic dismissal
- **Aggravated Damages:** Deliberate invocation of family tragedy

## Conclusion

The weaponisation of Dorian Thomson's suicide represents one of the most disturbing aspects of this case. Rather than learning from the tragedy — that EDS patients' pain complaints should be taken seriously — healthcare providers used it to justify the opposite: dismissing John's documented physical symptoms as psychological.

The pattern is evidenced by:
- **Seven documented GP entries** invoking the brother's death
- **Pain Clinic rejection** using family concerns as pretext
- **Independent witness verification** of the mechanism
- **Subsequent vindication** proving the physical pathology was real

John Thomson lost his brother to inadequate pain management. He then had that loss weaponised against him to deny him the care that might have prevented his own catastrophic injuries.

The system did not learn. It repeated.
