keyArguments:
  - "Psychiatric diagnosis applied without psychiatric assessment"
  - "Applied after objective pathology (vertebral fractures) confirmed on imaging"
  - "Patient never informed of diagnosis"
  - "Wrong ICD-10 code used (E278 instead of F45.4) suggesting unfamiliarity"
  - "Independently removed by subsequent GP as self-evidently inappropriate"
  - "Pain Clinic explicitly refuted somatoform characterisation"

## Executive Summary

On **5 January 2023**, during a routine telephone consultation about switching opioid medications, Dr Bulale Ali entered a diagnosis of **Somatoform Pain Disorder (F45.4)** into John Thomson's medical records. This occurred:

- **After** MRI imaging had already confirmed T5-T8 vertebral fractures
- **Without** any psychiatric assessment
- **Without** informing the patient

The diagnosis was later **independently removed** by Dr Alexander Gorrie in July 2025 with the note: *"there were clear causes for his pain."*

## The Clinical Context

### What Was Known at the Time

By January 2023, the following was documented in the patient's medical records:

1. **October 2022 MRI** - Confirmed T5-T8 vertebral fractures with "altered marrow signal" and "irregularity of the vertebral endplates"
2. **December 2021 Seizure** - Documented tonic-clonic seizure resulting in the fractures
3. **Ongoing Pain Management** - Patient under Pain Clinic care at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital
4. **Medication Requirements** - High-dose opioid requirements for documented pathology

### The Consultation of 5 January 2023

The purpose of the telephone consultation was to discuss **medication switching** from one opioid formulation to another. During this call:

- No psychiatric assessment was conducted
- No mental state examination was performed
- No questions about psychological symptoms were asked
- The patient was not informed a psychiatric diagnosis was being applied

Despite this, Dr Ali entered the following into the clinical record:

> **Diagnosis: Somatoform Pain Disorder**  
> *ICD-10 Code: E278 (incorrect - should be F45.4)*

The use of the wrong ICD-10 code (E278 is an endocrine disorder code) suggests unfamiliarity with the diagnosis being applied.

## Breach of Standard of Care

### GMC and NICE Requirements

The application of psychiatric diagnoses without appropriate assessment breaches multiple standards:

**GMC Good Medical Practice (2024):**
- Doctors must make "accurate diagnoses" based on "adequate assessment"
- Patients must be given information about their diagnosis
- Diagnoses should be within the doctor's competence

**NICE CG91 (Depression in Adults with Chronic Physical Health Problems):**
- Warns against misattributing physical symptoms to psychological causes
- Emphasises the need for proper psychiatric assessment before applying psychiatric diagnoses

### What Assessment Would Have Been Required

To legitimately diagnose Somatoform Pain Disorder (F45.4), the following would be necessary:

1. **Full psychiatric history**
2. **Mental state examination**
3. **Exclusion of organic causes** (impossible when fractures were already confirmed)
4. **Duration criteria** (symptoms >6 months causing significant distress)
5. **Differential diagnosis consideration**

None of these steps occurred.

## The "Contamination" Effect

### How the Label Spread

Once entered into the GP record, the somatoform diagnosis:

1. **Appeared in summary screens** visible to all subsequent clinicians
2. **Was transmitted via GP Connect** to NHS services
3. **Influenced clinical decision-making** in secondary care
4. **Created a psychiatric framing** for a patient with documented organic pathology

### Evidence of Impact

The Pain Clinic at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital later documented their explicit disagreement:

> *"GP prev told somatic, pain clinic at C&W; felt not somatic."*  
> — Pain Clinic clinical notes

This demonstrates that the inappropriate GP diagnosis was actively interfering with specialist pain management.

## Independent Vindication

### Dr Gorrie's Removal (July 2025)

Dr Alexander Gorrie, reviewing the patient's records as the new GP, **independently marked the Somatoform diagnosis as INACTIVE** with the following note:

> *"there were clear causes for his pain."*

This is highly unusual. GPs typically require formal psychiatric reassessment before removing psychiatric diagnoses. That Dr Gorrie removed it without such reassessment indicates the error was **self-evident** from reviewing the medical records.

### Pain Clinic Refutation (2023)

The Chelsea & Westminster Pain Clinic explicitly documented that the somatoform characterisation was:

> *"NOT their opinion"*

## Legal Significance

### Breach of Duty

The application of a psychiatric diagnosis:
- Without psychiatric assessment
- After objective pathology was confirmed
- Without patient knowledge

...constitutes a clear breach of the duty of care owed by a GP to their patient.

### Causation

The "contamination" of the medical record with this diagnosis:
- Influenced subsequent clinical encounters
- Created a barrier to appropriate treatment
- Caused psychological harm through the implication of fabrication

### The Bolam Test

No responsible body of GPs would support:
- Applying F45.4 without psychiatric assessment
- Applying somatoform diagnosis when organic pathology is confirmed
- Failing to inform the patient of such a diagnosis

## Conclusion

The entry of Somatoform Pain Disorder on 5 January 2023 represents a fundamental breach of medical standards. It was applied:

- **Inappropriately** - without assessment
- **Incorrectly** - despite confirmed fractures
- **Covertly** - without patient knowledge
- **Harmfully** - contaminating the medical record

The subsequent independent removal by Dr Gorrie, and explicit refutation by the Pain Clinic, confirm that this diagnosis should never have been applied.
