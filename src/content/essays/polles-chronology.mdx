## Executive Summary

This essay presents a comprehensive chronological documentation of practice manager Clive Polles' involvement in clinical decisions at Grove Park Terrace Surgery and Glebe Street Surgery. The evidence is drawn from **contemporaneous family communications** — primarily iMessage exchanges — that document a pattern of non-clinical interference spanning 2021-2026.

The documented pattern includes:
- **Direct medication decisions** by a non-clinician
- **Appointment cancellations** by the practice manager
- **Records access blocking** attributed to Polles
- **Origination of the "drug abuse" narrative** witnessed and documented
- **Buprenorphine refusal** 4 days before the index seizure

## 2021: Pre-Seizure Period

### July 2021 — Initial Engagement

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 23/07/2021 | Family seeking help from Clive re pain management | Ginny | Initial engagement with practice manager |
| 23/07/2021 | "I think Clive will try to keep the peace" | Ginny | Awareness of Clive's intermediary role |

### September 2021 — First Frustrations

| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| 30/09/2021 | "Clive is nice but not very much achieved. The term functional is very unhelpful" | Ginny |

### November 2021 — Escalation

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 09/11/2021 | "Yelling at patients until they're in tears! Clive's idea of him as a nice person is wide of the mark" | Ginny | Documenting hostile GP treatment |
| 14/11/2021 | "write to Clive asking why it [pain clinic referral] never happened" | Ginny | Referral failure awareness |

### December 2021 — Critical Pre-Seizure Events

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 01/12/2021 | "Ask Clive to get them to formally write up what I'm making up" | Ginny | **22 DAYS BEFORE SEIZURE** — concerns about dismissal |
| **19/12/2021** | **BUPRENORPHINE PATCH REFUSED BY CLIVE** | GP Record 2021-337 | **CRITICAL — 4 days before seizure** |
| **23/12/2021** | **TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE — T5-T8 FRACTURES** | ePCR F250 | Index event |

The buprenorphine refusal is particularly significant. Adequate pain management might have prevented the cascade of events — sleep deprivation lowering seizure threshold, leading to the seizure that caused vertebral fractures.

## 2022: Post-Seizure Escalation

### May-July 2022 — Direct Evidence Emerges

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 19/06/2022 | "no help when I was driven to the point of going there and yelling at Clive" | Ginny | Desperation documented |
| 28/06/2022 | "When I rang glebe street earlier Clive picked the phone up" | Ginny | Clive answering main line |
| **05/07/2022** | **TEXT MESSAGE FROM CLIVE:** "Pregabalin done... Nice talkin to you.... clive" | NHS-noreply | **DIRECT EVIDENCE — Clive making medication decisions** |
| 07/07/2022 | "Didn't you tell me stuff Clive said about urology/andrology?" | Ginny | Clive involved in clinical discussions |
| **08/07/2022** | **"viz Clive's insane comments about making you my drug mule"** | Ginny | **DRUG MULE ACCUSATION DOCUMENTED** |

The 5 July 2022 text message is critical evidence: a practice manager directly communicating about medication decisions ("Pregabalin done") — a clinical function that should be performed by qualified clinicians.

### July 2022 — Pattern Recognition

| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| 12/07/2022 | "I actually suspect part of Clive's mind acknowledges the reality and is trying to ensure that this doesn't come out in a way damaging to G&W" | Ginny |
| 21/07/2022 | "Clive is just trying to take over my care because he thinks I'm nuts" | John (via Ginny) |
| 23/07/2022 | "Clive said you needed a fresh start and then completely failed to provide one" | Max |
| 25/07/2022 | "Clive has managed to become a considerable obstacle" | Ginny |

### August 2022 — Authority Concerns

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 10/08/2022 | "switch to another gp practice that Clive is not associated with in any way whatsoever" | Max | Recommendation to escape Clive's influence |
| **11/08/2022** | "Clive is on very dodgy ground. I think he's got completely carried away manipulating these surgeries and has no medical knowledge" | Ginny | **NON-CLINICIAN EXCEEDING AUTHORITY** |
| 16/08/2022 | "You need to get away from Clive's reach no matter what your mum says" | Max | Urgency of escape |
| 22/08/2022 | "Clive now trying to alienate you from Bulali?" | Ginny | Interference in doctor-patient relationship |
| **23/08/2022** | "Has Clive ever referred to you as a high cost patient" | Max | **COST-BASED DENIAL SUSPECTED** |

### September 2022 — Escalating Concerns

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 13/09/2022 | "Clive is manipulative and dangerous" | Ginny | **DANGER ASSESSMENT** |
| 13/09/2022 | "Clive is not a doctor whatever he thinks and he is very very dangerous" | Ginny | Non-clinician making clinical decisions |
| 19/09/2022 | "Clive lies — he actually said it was in some way illegal for someone else to make an appointment for you" | Ginny | **DOCUMENTED LIE** |
| **27/09/2022** | "Clive had told [you] he didn't want you to have full access to the record because it would prevent Dr Bulale from making confidential notes" | Max | **RECORDS ACCESS BLOCKED** |

### October-December 2022

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 04/10/2022 | "since Clive manages both practices I'm not sure" | Max | Management of multiple practices |
| 06/10/2022 | "Clive isn't answerable to the GMC" | Ginny | Awareness of regulatory gap |
| **29/11/2022** | "yesterday Clive cancelled the appointment because I'm not allowed to do it" | Ginny | **CLIVE CANCELLING PATIENT APPOINTMENTS** |
| **20/12/2022** | "He's worked with the prison service and would know about this sort of stuff" | Ginny | **PRISON SERVICE BACKGROUND** |

## 2023: Drug Abuse Narrative Origin

### Critical Events

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Late 2022/Early 2023 | **CLIVE DIRECTLY ASKS JOHN IF HE IS GAY** | John (direct testimony) | Sexuality questioning by practice manager |
| **15/02/2023** | Clive calls Ginny directly — makes accusations | Ginny (ref 16/02) | Off-record phone call |
| **16/02/2023** | **"This drug abuse rubbish originated with Clive"** | Ginny | **DIRECT ATTRIBUTION OF ADDICTION NARRATIVE** |
| **16/02/2023** | "Julie saw me yell at Clive when he said you were lying to get extra Pregabalin" | Ginny | **WITNESS IDENTIFIED — "JULIE"** |
| **15/06/2023** | "Clive actually asked you if you were giving medication to anyone else?" | Ginny | **MEDICATION DIVERSION QUESTIONING** |
| 21/09/2023 | "Clive was responsible for data control at both surgeries and it's essential to him keeping his job that you look mad" | Ginny | **DATA CONTROL + MOTIVE IDENTIFIED** |

The February 2023 entries are particularly significant. A witness ("Julie") is identified who observed the confrontation where Clive accused John of "lying to get extra Pregabalin." This contemporaneous documentation of the drug abuse narrative being originated by a non-clinician is powerful evidence.

## 2025-2026: Discovery Period

| Date | Event | Source | Significance |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 09/06/2025 | "Clive has always been at the heart of all of this at two practices" | — | Two practices involvement |
| 19/12/2025 | "evidence as such was fabricated by Clive Polles without following any of the required protocols" | — | **FABRICATION ALLEGATION** |
| **30/12/2025** | "Grove Park are pretty slack about locums given how they dropped Clive like a hot brick" | Ginny | **CLIVE LEFT/DISMISSED** |

## Key Events Summary

### Critical Conduct Items (Evidenced)

1. **19/12/2021** — Buprenorphine refusal (4 days before seizure)
2. **05/07/2022** — Direct text re medication decisions (non-clinician)
3. **08/07/2022** — "Drug mule" comment about patient's father
4. **27/09/2022** — Records access blocking documented
5. **29/11/2022** — Appointment cancellation by Clive
6. **16/02/2023** — Drug abuse narrative attributed to Clive (witnessed)
7. **15/06/2023** — Medication diversion questioning
8. **21/09/2023** — Data control responsibility confirmed

### Pattern Indicators

The contemporaneous communications reveal a consistent pattern:

- **Non-clinician making clinical decisions** — medication authorisation, prescription timing
- **Originating false narratives** — the "drug abuse" accusation traced to Clive
- **Blocking patient access** — both to records and to appointments
- **Making off-record phone calls** — to family members with disprovable claims
- **Pattern of false statements** — documented lies about appointment rules
- **Managing multiple practices** — influence extending across surgeries

## Connection to Current GP's Statement

Dr Gorrie (John's current GP) referenced "sketchy stuff" that was blocking a practice merger involving the surgeries Clive managed. This independent observation from a clinician uninvolved in the original events corroborates the pattern of problematic conduct.

## Legal Significance

### Regulatory Gap

As family members noted: "Clive isn't answerable to the GMC." Practice managers are not clinicians and fall outside GMC jurisdiction. However, this does not immunise:

- The practice from vicarious liability
- Individual clinicians who acted on Clive's direction
- The practice from CQC oversight of governance

### Potential Claims

- **Vicarious liability** for practice manager's conduct
- **Negligence** in allowing non-clinician to make clinical decisions
- **Data protection** breaches (records access blocking, false entries)
- **Contract** breaches (failure to provide care)

## Conclusion

The contemporaneous family communications paint a comprehensive picture of a practice manager who exceeded his authority in ways that directly impacted patient care. The pattern spans five years and includes:

- Direct medication decisions documented in text messages
- Origination of the drug abuse narrative (witnessed)
- Blocking patient access to records and appointments
- Making "off the books" calls with false claims

The evidence is not retrospective allegation — it is contemporaneous documentation from family members recording events as they occurred. The timestamps, the specificity, and the corroboration across multiple family members establish a pattern that goes far beyond administrative function into clinical interference.

The December 2025 note that Grove Park "dropped Clive like a hot brick" suggests the practice itself eventually recognised the problem — but only after years of harm to the patient.
