summary: "Documents the causation chain linking abrupt pregabalin reduction (600mg to 100mg) in October 2021 to the seizure event on 23 December 2021.

keyArguments:

## Executive Summary

On **23 December 2021**, John Thomson experienced a tonic-clonic seizure that resulted in T5-T8 vertebral fractures. This essay documents the causation chain linking this seizure to **abrupt pregabalin withdrawal** two months earlier.

The British National Formulary (BNF) explicitly warns that pregabalin withdrawal can cause seizures and mandates gradual reduction. This guidance was not followed.

## The Medication: Pregabalin

### Clinical Use

Pregabalin (Lyrica) is a gabapentinoid medication used for:
- Neuropathic pain
- Generalised anxiety disorder
- Epilepsy (adjunctive therapy)

John Thomson was prescribed pregabalin **600mg daily** for neuropathic pain management.

### Known Withdrawal Risks

The BNF states:

> *"Abrupt withdrawal of pregabalin should be avoided... withdraw gradually over at least 1 week"*

The BNF specifically lists **seizures** as a withdrawal effect, even in patients without epilepsy history.

## The Withdrawal Event: October 2021

### The Prescription Change

In October 2021, John Thomson's pregabalin was reduced from **600mg to 100mg** — an 83% reduction — over approximately **2-3 days**.

This was dramatically faster than the BNF-mandated minimum of 1 week for gradual withdrawal.

### Contributing Factors

At the time of withdrawal, the patient was also experiencing:

**1. Severe Sleep Deprivation**
- 14+ months of documented sleep disturbance
- Pain preventing restorative sleep
- Sleep deprivation is a known seizure threshold-lowering factor

**2. Untreated Pain**
- Medication changes were affecting pain control
- Stress from uncontrolled pain can lower seizure threshold

## The Seizure: 23 December 2021

### Timeline

- **October 2021**: Pregabalin abruptly reduced
- **November-December 2021**: Two months of subtherapeutic pregabalin
- **23 December 2021**: Tonic-clonic seizure at home

### The Event

The seizure resulted in:
- Fall with high-impact trauma
- T5-T8 vertebral fractures
- Rib injuries
- Subsequent chronic pain requiring escalated management

## Independent Specialist Confirmation

### Dr Simeoni's Documentation

Dr Simeoni, reviewing the patient's history, documented:

> *"When had a seizure pregabalin had been stopped abruptly"*

This independent clinical correlation directly links the abrupt withdrawal to the seizure event.

### Formal Epilepsy Diagnosis

In **December 2024**, the patient received a **formal epilepsy diagnosis** from Imperial College Healthcare neurology services.

This is significant because:
- The seizure was **not functional/dissociative** (NEAD)
- It was a **genuine neurological event**
- The patient has ongoing seizure risk requiring management

## The Pattern Repeats

### OxyContin Withdrawal Warning Ignored

Despite the pregabalin/seizure connection being documented, the same GP practice later:

1. **Abruptly stopped OxyContin** (strong opioid)
2. **Despite Pain Clinic warning** that abrupt cessation risked seizures
3. **Same pattern** of ignoring withdrawal guidance

The Pain Clinic had specifically documented:

> *"Do not stop OxyContin abruptly — seizure risk"*

This warning was not heeded.

## Causation Analysis

### The "But For" Test

**But for** the abrupt pregabalin reduction:
- The patient's seizure threshold would not have been lowered
- The 23 December 2021 seizure would not have occurred
- The vertebral fractures would not have been sustained
- The subsequent cascade of harm would not have followed

### Contributory Negligence Assessment

The causation chain includes:

1. **Breach**: Abrupt pregabalin withdrawal contrary to BNF guidance
2. **Vulnerability**: Sleep deprivation lowering seizure threshold
3. **Event**: Tonic-clonic seizure on 23 December 2021
4. **Harm**: T5-T8 fractures, chronic pain, ongoing epilepsy

Each link in this chain is documented in medical records.

## Standard of Care Analysis

### BNF Guidance

The British National Formulary is the UK standard reference for medication prescribing. Its guidance on pregabalin withdrawal is:

- Withdraw **gradually**
- Over **at least 1 week**
- **Seizures** are a documented withdrawal effect

### What Should Have Happened

A competent GP reducing pregabalin from 600mg should have:

1. **Planned a taper** over minimum 1 week (typically 2-4 weeks from 600mg)
2. **Warned the patient** about withdrawal symptoms
3. **Monitored** for adverse effects
4. **Not reduced** more than 50-75mg per day

None of these steps occurred.

## The Ongoing Impact

### Epilepsy Diagnosis

The patient now has:
- Formal epilepsy diagnosis
- Ongoing antiepileptic medication requirements
- Restrictions on driving
- Ongoing seizure risk

### Physical Harm

The seizure caused:
- T5-T8 vertebral fractures
- Chronic pain requiring opioid management
- Functional limitations
- 10-month diagnostic delay (see separate essay)

### Psychological Harm

The patient experienced:
- Trauma from the seizure event
- Frustration at preventable harm
- Damage to trust in medical care

## Conclusion

The causation chain from abrupt pregabalin withdrawal to the December 2021 seizure is clearly established:

1. **BNF guidance** requires gradual pregabalin withdrawal
2. **This guidance was breached** — 83% reduction over 2-3 days
3. **Two months later** — tonic-clonic seizure occurred
4. **Independent specialist** documented the causal link
5. **Formal epilepsy diagnosis** confirms genuine neurological event

The subsequent vertebral fractures and their consequences flow directly from this negligent medication management.
