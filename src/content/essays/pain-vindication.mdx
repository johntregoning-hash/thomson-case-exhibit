summary: "Detailed analysis of the pattern where John Thomson's pain reporting was dismissed as psychological or exaggerated, until independent specialists and imaging vindicated every complaint."
keyArguments:
  - "Pain consistently documented but attributed to 'somatoform' causes"
  - "GP claimed 'imaging normal' but wrong area was scanned"
  - "Patient explicitly requested scan - GP declined"
  - "Pain Clinic explicitly refuted somatoform characterisation"
  - "Independent specialists vindicated all physical complaints"

## The Core Injustice

**The Pattern:**
1. Patient suffered T5-T8 vertebral fractures and rib fractures during seizure on 23 December 2021
2. Patient reported IDENTICAL pain symptoms continuously for 6+ months
3. Patient explicitly reported breathing difficulties alongside the pain
4. GP claimed "imaging has all been normal" — but imaging was of WRONG AREA
5. Patient requested scans — GP DECLINED
6. Patient was VINDICATED when proper imaging revealed T5-T8 fractures (~October 2022)
7. DESPITE vindication and Pain Clinic saying pain was NOT somatic, GP applied somatoform diagnosis

**Why This Is Egregious:**
- The pain was real (fractures confirmed)
- The breathing difficulties were real (fractures affect respiratory mechanics)
- The imaging claims were false (CXR misses fractures, and they imaged wrong area)
- To then claim the pain was psychological (somatoform) AFTER specialists confirmed organic pathology is medically and legally indefensible

## Complete Pain Reporting Timeline

### 23 December 2021 — The Index Event

**Event:** First tonic-clonic seizure
**Injury:** Fall causing T5-T8 vertebral fractures and rib fractures
**Initial Response:** A&E attendance at Charing Cross Hospital

### 24 December 2021 — Day 1 Post-Seizure

**Entry ID:** 2021-491 | **Clinician:** Dr Priya Khemani

> "C/O severe back pain"

**Key Findings:**
- Severe back pain documented ONE DAY after seizure
- Already ran out of 84 codeine tablets given 10 days prior
- Focus on codeine usage rather than investigating cause

### 29 December 2021 — Multiple OOH Reports

**Entry IDs:** 2021-495, 2021-497

TWO separate Out of Hours incident reports filed on same day — indicating ongoing pain severe enough to require after-hours medical contact.

### 31 December 2021 — Critical Appointment

**Entry ID:** 2021-510 | **Clinician:** Dr Yewande Idowu

**Clinical Text:**
> "sustained a soft tissue injury to the back after a seizure episode about a week ago. still having pain under the right shoulder blade, worse with movement"
>
> **"imaging has all been normal"**

**CRITICAL FALSE STATEMENT:** "imaging has all been normal"

**Why This Is False:**
- CXR (chest X-ray) misses approximately 50% of rib fractures
- The fractures were at T5-T8 vertebrae — NOT where CXR imaging covers
- Proper thoracic spine MRI was never ordered at this stage
- This false reassurance prevented proper investigation for ~10 MONTHS

### 17 January 2022 — Patient Reports Broken Rib

**Entry ID:** 2022-025 | **Source:** HCH MSK, Pain Management & Hands Service

> "patient called at Chiswick health centre reception and requested to cancel his appointment as **broken rib and in a lot of pain**"

**Why This Should Have Triggered Investigation:**
- Patient explicitly reported BROKEN RIB — not just "pain"
- Standard of care would require imaging to investigate fracture
- Instead, appointment was simply cancelled with no follow-up

### 21 January 2022 — Breathing Difficulties Documented

**Entry ID:** 2022-029 | **Clinician:** Dr Priya Khemani

> "C/O R sided rib pain since seizure"
>
> "**feels SOB when lying on that side**"
>
> "No rib # seen on CXR"

**Documented Breathing Difficulties:**
The patient accurately reported shortness of breath (SOB) when lying on the affected side. This is EXACTLY what happens with rib/vertebral fractures — broken bones hurt when you try to breathe deeply or lie on them. This is physics, not psychology.

### 31 January 2022 — Scan Request Declined

**Entry ID:** 2022-045 | **Clinician:** Laura Harrington

**Clinical Text:**
> "Patient would like a scan in his ribs following a fall 5 weeks ago. Normal CT and CXR — no rib # were picked up"
>
> "**Has been breathless but feels that it is because he is unable to take a big deep breath**"
>
> "Twisting causes a sharp pain and rates **9/10**"
>
> "Explained an **CXR would not change management plan**"

**PATIENT REQUESTED SCAN — GP DECLINED**

The patient accurately identified that his breathlessness was due to inability to take deep breaths — which is EXACTLY what happens with rib/vertebral fractures. The mechanical restriction of chest wall movement from fractures limits inspiratory capacity.

**Severe Pain Documented:**
- Pain at rest: 5/6 out of 10
- Pain with movement (twisting): **9/10**
- This is SEVERE pain — and was being dismissed

### 25 March 2022 — A&E vs GP

**Entry ID:** 2022-133 | **Clinician:** Dr Priya Khemani

> "Was advised in ED to have 60 mg codeine QDS but would mean will run out of meds sooner"
>
> "i'm **reluctant** to increase codeine dose further at present"

**Critical Finding:**
- Patient had been to A&E
- A&E recommended 60mg codeine four times daily
- GP stated she was "reluctant" to prescribe what A&E recommended
- PATTERN: GP consistently minimising pain that A&E took seriously

### 19 May 2022 — 5 Months Post-Seizure

**Entry ID:** 2022-198 | **Clinician:** Dr Yewande Idowu

> "**ongoing rib pain** after fall in Feb"
>
> "still waiting to be seen in the pain clinic"

STILL complaining of same pain nearly 5 months later. Still waiting for basic CXR. Still waiting for Pain Clinic. PATTERN: Delays, referrals, but no proper investigation.

### June 2022 — 6 Month Mark

At the 6-month post-seizure mark, patient STILL complaining of same pain. Documentation includes possible seizure in bed, ongoing pain, 111 advising A&E attendance.

## The False Imaging Claims

### What GP Records Claimed

| Date | Claim |
|------|-------|
| 31 Dec 2021 | "imaging has all been normal" |
| 21 Jan 2022 | "No rib # seen on CXR" |
| 31 Jan 2022 | "Normal CT and CXR" |

### What Was Actually Imaged

- **CXR (Chest X-ray):** Shows lungs, heart, limited rib visualization
- **CT Head:** Shows brain, not spine

### What Should Have Been Imaged

- **Thoracic Spine MRI:** The T5-T8 region where fractures were located

### The Reality

- T5-T8 vertebral fractures are NOT visible on CXR
- CXR misses approximately 50% of rib fractures
- CT head is completely irrelevant to thoracic spine injuries
- The fractures were eventually found on MRI approximately **10 months later**

**Conclusion:** The GP claimed "imaging was normal" when the CORRECT imaging was never done.

## The Vindication

### October 2022 — MRI Finally Reveals Fractures

- T5-T8 vertebral fractures confirmed
- Rib fractures confirmed
- The pain patient had been reporting for ~10 months was REAL

### Key Specialist Statements

**Pain Clinic (October 2022):**
> "Under FND clinic at St Georges — **diagnosis not confirmed yet**"

The Pain Clinic explicitly stated FND (Functional Neurological Disorder) was NOT confirmed.

**Pain Clinic Psychologist:**
> "**NOT their opinion**" that pain was somatic

**Dr Mehta (May 2023):**
> "the diagnosis of **functional neurological disorder has recently been brought into question**"

**Dr Karunaratne, Neurologist (December 2023):**
> "Today was the first time he sounded somewhat positive in a very long time. This is largely due to the fact that **medical explanations have been found for symptoms that he has been experiencing for a very long time**."

**Dr Gorrie (July 2025):**
Marked somatoform diagnosis as **INACTIVE** citing:
> "**clear causes for his pain**"

## The Somatoform Scandal

### The Diagnosis That Should Never Have Been Made

**Entry 2023-005 — 5 January 2023**
**Clinician:** Dr Bulale
**Method:** TELEPHONE CALL about medication (oxycontin vs morphine switch)
**Diagnosis Applied:** Somatoform pain disorder (E278)

### What Makes This Egregious

1. **No Psychiatric Assessment:** Somatoform disorder requires psychiatric evaluation — NONE was performed

2. **Contradicted Specialist Opinion:** The Pain Clinic psychologist explicitly stated the pain was NOT somatic

3. **Applied AFTER Fractures Found:** By January 2023, the T5-T8 fractures had already been identified on MRI (October 2022)

4. **Applied via Telephone:** A telephone call about medication switching is not the appropriate setting for applying a major psychiatric diagnosis

5. **Applied by Non-Specialist:** Dr Bulale (Clinical Practitioner) is not a psychiatrist

### Timeline of Contradiction

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Oct 2022 | MRI shows T5-T8 fractures | PHYSICAL injury confirmed |
| Oct 2022 | Pain Clinic: "FND not confirmed" | Specialist disagreed with functional diagnosis |
| Oct 2022 | Pain Clinic psychologist: "not somatic" | Direct contradiction of somatoform |
| **5 Jan 2023** | **SOMATOFORM APPLIED** | **Applied without assessment, against specialist opinion** |
| May 2023 | Dr Mehta: "FND brought into question" | Another specialist challenge |
| Jul 2025 | Dr Gorrie marks INACTIVE | Finally reversed, citing "clear causes" |

### Patient's Own Words

**Entry 2024-077:**
> "previous GP was more interested in making a diagnosis up themselves that it was a somatic pain disorder (Jan 2023, Junior GP explicitly against the assessment of the psychologist I'd spoken to at the Chelsea Westminster Pain Clinic"

## Independent Clinical Witness

### Sumeer Bhamm, MSK Physiotherapist (September 2021)

**Pain Rating:** **9/10** — documented by independent clinician
**Significance:** Professional clinician documented severe pain and expressed concern about GP dismissal pattern

This is INDEPENDENT verification of the pain severity from someone outside the GP surgery.

## Summary of Evidence

### What Patient Consistently Reported (Dec 2021 - Jun 2022)

- Severe back/rib pain (rated up to 9/10)
- Pain worse with movement/twisting
- Breathing difficulties ("SOB", "unable to take a big deep breath")
- Pain in same location (right scapular/rib area — corresponding to T5-T8)
- Pain since the seizure on 23 December 2021

### What GP Response Was

- "Imaging is normal" (wrong area imaged)
- "Monitor at home"
- "CXR wouldn't change management" (scan request denied)
- "Reluctant" to prescribe pain relief recommended by A&E
- Referred to physiotherapy instead of imaging
- Eventually applied somatoform diagnosis without assessment

### What Actually Existed

- T5-T8 vertebral fractures
- Rib fractures
- Real, organic, structural pathology
- Eventually confirmed by MRI ~10 months post-injury

## Legal Significance

### What This Proves

The evidence establishes:

1. **The symptoms were real** — documented organic pathology
2. **The complaints were consistent** — same pain location, same character, reported repeatedly
3. **The imaging claims were false** — wrong area was scanned
4. **The patient's requests were denied** — scan specifically requested and declined
5. **The psychiatric diagnosis was inappropriate** — applied after fractures confirmed, against specialist opinion

### The Injustice

After being vindicated by MRI showing the fractures were real, after Pain Clinic stating the pain was NOT somatic, the GP surgery STILL applied a somatoform pain disorder diagnosis. This diagnosis:

- Was applied without psychiatric assessment
- Contradicted specialist opinion
- Was applied via telephone call
- Stigmatised a patient with documented organic pathology
- Was not reversed until July 2025

## Conclusion

The pain reporting and vindication evidence in this case is **overwhelming**:

- **6+ months** of consistent pain reporting
- **Breathing difficulties** accurately explained by the patient
- **Scan request denied** by GP
- **Wrong imaging** cited as "normal"
- **10 months** before proper imaging performed
- **Complete vindication** — every complaint had organic cause
- **Somatoform applied anyway** — despite specialist disagreement

John Thomson's pain was real. His explanations were accurate. His requests for proper investigation were denied. When imaging finally confirmed what he had been saying all along, he was given a psychiatric diagnosis that contradicted the findings.

The defence cannot argue that the pain was not real when MRI confirmed vertebral fractures. The defence cannot argue that imaging was normal when the correct area was never scanned. The defence cannot argue that somatoform was appropriate when the specialists who assessed him disagreed.

The evidence speaks for itself.
